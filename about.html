        <p>I’m a freelance designer based in Bristol with nearly a decade of experience in the creative industry, six of those spent as a senior designer at multi-disciplinary creative studio Beef.</p>
        <p>Happiest when tinkering in digital or print, I’ve tackled; advertising, apps, artworking, branding, campaigns, communications, packaging, publications, typesetting, and website UI.</p>
